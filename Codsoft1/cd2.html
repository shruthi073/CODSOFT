                <h3>Automated billing trolley using Arduino and RFID technology</h3>
                <img src="Gemini_Generated_Image_qgal6eqgal6eqgal.jpg" alt="Project 1 Screenshot">
                <p>Developed an Arduino and RFID technology-based Automated Billing Trolley to streamline the checkout process. 
                    The trolley is equipped with an RFID reader that scans RFID tags on products and communicates with an Arduino 
                    microcontroller. Each time an item is placed in the trolley, its information and price are automatically refreshed. 
                    This setup continuously calculates the total bill, eliminating the necessity for manual scanning during checkout.</p>

            <h3>Project-2:</h3>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>IoT based Earthquake and Hazardous Gases Detection in Coal Mines using Raspberry Pi</h3>
                <img src="Gemini_Generated_Image_to8m7xto8m7xto8m.jpg" alt="Project 2 Screenshot">
                <p>Designed an IoT-enabled system for detecting earthquakes and hazardous gases in coal mines, utilizing Raspberry 
                    Pi, enhances safety by monitoring seismic activity and identifying harmful gas concentrations. This system employs 
                    sensors to measure vibrations and gas levels, transmitting real-time information to a central server over the Internet.</p>  </div>
